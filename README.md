Partial Response
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/simondean/partial-response.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/simondean/partial-response)

This project provides a library to help with the processing and implementation of
[partial response](http://googlecode.blogspot.co.uk/2010/03/making-apis-faster-introducing-partial.html) in an API.

The core library consists of parsers, AST, visitors and matcher for working with a partial response value. Higher level
functionality may be added over time including http filters for xml and json to post process your responses for
inclusion in the partial response.

Usage
-----

To use this in your Maven project simply include the dependency

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.simondean.partial-response</groupId>
  <artifactId>matcher</artifactId>
  <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

This will give you the `Matcher` class which is the core concept for partial response. The `Matcher` gives you a way to
parse and match against a partial response pattern.

```java
Matcher matcher = Matcher.of("name,address,spouse(name,address),children/*");

// matches all of these Leafs
assertTrue(matcher.matches("/name"));
assertTrue(matcher.matches("/address"));
assertTrue(matcher.matches("/address/houseNumber"));
assertTrue(matcher.matches("/spouse/name"));
assertTrue(matcher.matches("/spouse/address"));
assertTrue(matcher.matches("/children"));
assertTrue(matcher.matches("/children/any/path"));

// doesn't match any of these
assertFalse(matcher.matches("/unknown"));
assertFalse(matcher.matches("/spouse/children"));
// Note: spouse as a leaf is not included, only certain sub properties are
assertFalse(matcher.matches("/spouse"));
```

Out of the box
--------------

This project consists of a number of sub-projects to cover different use cases for partial-response.

 * [Matcher](matcher) - contains the core pattern parsers and Matcher class. This is the low level functionality behind
   all partial response support
 * [Jackson JSON Filter](filter-json-jackson) - Partial response filter for Jackson JSON serialisation.
 * [JAX-RS Jackson JSON Filter](filter-json-jackson-jaxrs) - JAX-RS response filter for applying partial-response to
   JAX-RS based REST API responses.
