   * Implementation note:
   *
   * In order to support filtering based on a Matcher we need to be able to support the inclusions of parent elements
   * when a child should be included. Unfortunately this is not directly supported by the standard classes.
   *
   * To accomplish this we need to do two passes over the object tree. Pass one navigates to all leaf nodes of the tree
   * looking for paths that should be included in the output. Once all these are found a second pass goes through
   * writing out all included paths.
   *
   * The reason for the two paths is because the standard tree walking algorithm of jackson writes at the same time it
   * navigates. We don't know if a parent should be written until we've seen it's children, something that can't be
   * done without a no-op first pass.
